# ESP32 Evaluation Setup
This folder contains the ESP32 implementation to test the proposed NIC design on an embedded real-time system. It can be built and flashed to an ESP32 using the ESP-IDF (see below). Before building, make sure that the interrupt trace to be investigated has been generated by the NIC simulator and transformed to a C header file using trace2blob.sh. 



ESP-IDF template app
====================

This is a template application to be used with [Espressif IoT Development Framework](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf).

Please check [ESP-IDF docs](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for getting started instructions.
